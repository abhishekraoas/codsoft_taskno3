# ATM Machine Java Application

This Java application simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using a simple text-based interface. It allows users to check their balance, deposit funds, and withdraw funds from their bank account.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run the Java Program:**

      To compile and run the `ATM_Machine.java` program, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `ATM_Machine.java` file is located, and execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac ATM_Machine.java
   java ATM_Machine
   ```
## Use the ATM Simulator:

Once the program is running, you will be presented with a text-based menu. You can perform the following actions:
<ul><li> Check Balance: Displays your current account balance. </li>
<li>Deposit: Allows you to deposit funds into your account. </li>
<li>Withdraw: Allows you to withdraw funds from your account.</li>
<li>Exit: Terminates the ATM simulator.</li></ul>
